- implement the build script [13-02-2021]
- find out why when I move the donkeykong game executable to the game/ dir it cannot find the
 shared object for the engine - can I link the engine statically instead? Or can I simply copy
 the engine .so to an appropriate dir in the game dir.

 - I also want debug and release build - will need a way to specify which to build via the 
 build.sh script.
