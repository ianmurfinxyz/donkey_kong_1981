- implement the build script [13-02-2021]
- find out why when I move the donkeykong game executable to the game/ dir it cannot find the
 shared object for the engine - can I link the engine statically instead? Or can I simply copy
 the engine .so to an appropriate dir in the game dir.

 - I also want debug and release build - will need a way to specify which to build via the 
 build.sh script.

 - implement the data driven prop and level systems

 - design a basic level with some props (no enemies of win conditions just yet)

 - get the thing built and tested.

 - The initial goal is to get mario moving around a world of obstacles: platforms, ladders,
 moving platforms, conveyors, spring things, blowers, saw blades, trapdoors etc.

- may want to create a representation of a prop definition in memory so I can load the prop
defs into this in RAM representation - a struct seperate to the instances of the prop.

 - need the GameProp class to actually act as an instance of a prop.

 - need the app to load all the prop definitions

 - need the level to load a level file - the level should reference prop defintions already
 loaded
