- implement the build script [13-02-2021]
- find out why when I move the donkeykong game executable to the game/ dir it cannot find the
 shared object for the engine - can I link the engine statically instead? Or can I simply copy
 the engine .so to an appropriate dir in the game dir.

 - I also want debug and release build - will need a way to specify which to build via the 
 build.sh script.

 - implement the data driven prop and level systems

 - design a basic level with some props (no enemies of win conditions just yet)

 - get the thing built and tested.

 - The initial goal is to get mario moving around a world of obstacles: platforms, ladders,
 moving platforms, conveyors, spring things, blowers, saw blades, trapdoors etc.

- may want to create a representation of a prop definition in memory so I can load the prop
defs into this in RAM representation - a struct seperate to the instances of the prop.

 - need the GameProp class to actually act as an instance of a prop.

 - need the app to load all the prop definitions

 - need the level to load a level file - the level should reference prop defintions already
 loaded

- finish the interaction boxes for mario and test the collision tests

- compile and test and what not

- a problem is down the road - at min when interacting with a support am setting marios y
position to the support y position. The problem however is that marios position is the position
of the center of mario not the bottom, thus I need to actually set the center position of mario
based on the support height, but how do I know what this center position needs to be? I will
need to the get the y-axis origin of the current animations sprite and adjust the support 
position, add the origin to it or something. To do this will need to add the ability to get
the origin from the pxr gfx module and the animation class.

- improve the ladder climbing - add a climb on animation which is the reverse of the climb off
animation, add a ladder idle animation, and implement the climbing off the bottom of the ladder
properly as at min it doesn't work.

- make mario die! upon death need to:
    - run the death animation sequence via the mario class
    - have the level class detect the death and inform the owning play state the level is lost.
    - the owning play state will then reset the level or end the game if no lives.
